# CEO reviews — the standing record

**Rule 25 says hand each new CEO "the previous CEO's verdict", so it can say whether the same fault
is recurring. Until 2026-08-26 that verdict lived only in the running session's context — so the
moment a session ended, the mechanism that catches RECURRING faults quietly stopped working.**
This file is where verdicts live now. `4/scripts/qa/ceo_brief.mjs` reads the newest entry
automatically.

**APPEND ONLY. Newest at the top. Never edit an old verdict** — a review that was wrong is evidence
about the reviewer and belongs on the record exactly as it was written.

## Review 5 — 2026-08-26 · are today's learnings PERMANENT?
**One sentence:** *"He got the writing he asked for, and it is good writing — but almost none of
today's lessons are enforced by a machine, the one new pointer that WAS added to an enforced table
was added to the prose copy and not the code copy, and the drill that is supposed to prove any of
this works still cannot fail."*

- Of eight lessons, **two became machinery** (evidence-based NOT-RUN; painted-text settle). Six are prose.
- **Caught:** the commit whose purpose was permanence added a row to CLAUDE.md §4 and skipped
  `SUBSYSTEMS` in `.claude/hooks/read-the-doc-first.cjs` — the only copy a machine reads.
- **Caught a factual error:** the docs said the seed drill "grades by grepping for FAIL/✗". It grades
  on **exit status** (`seed_drill.mjs:72`); the grep is only a display line. Right conclusion, wrong
  stated cause — review 4's charge recurring the same day.
- **Highest leverage unbuilt:** give the seed drill a **baseline control run**.
- **Volume:** HARD-WON-LESSONS is 1316 lines; §10 is 106 lines saying one thing. Cut §10c/e/f/g to
  one line each. "Point, don't restate" was violated — the loop now exists in 3–4 copies.

**Acted on:** hook table fixed; `4/scripts/doc_command_check.js` built (went red on the real defect,
then green); this file created; CEO made runnable.

## Review 4 — 2026-08-26 · the two game fixes
**One sentence:** *"You are being handed one fix and one hypothesis, and they are not labelled
differently."*
- Verified the Firebase fix **the hard way** — reverted `watchers.js` in a scratch tree and re-ran:
  3 of 5 checks failed. "The test is real, not self-satisfying."
- The covering fix shipped on a stated cause that was **measurably wrong on one of the three
  screenshots it cited** (host-016 had ~36px of headroom; the clamp was not binding there).
- Retry budget was keyed per TURN, not per prompt — one turn holds many prompts.
- **Standing charge:** *"This session writes its best guess in the voice of a finding, and that voice
  survives into the file where the next reader will believe it."*

## Review 3 — 2026-08-26 · the remote-control work
**One sentence:** *"The rewrite you asked for is accurate… but no game code was touched today."*
- Found three unbacked claims, including a **fabricated verbatim quote** transcribed two ways.
- Found the "red-proofed" claim had **no artifact** behind it — a sentence about a measurement.
- Standing charge: *"excellent at diagnosing its own process and still slow to act on the diagnosis."*

## Review 2 — 2026-08-26 · the QA process
**One sentence:** *"He asked for three things and got one and a half."*
- **The sweep command the process printed did not exist** — `qa/matrix.mjs`, deleted that morning,
  still referenced in five places.
- The report still said PASSED after the code was fixed; the artifact was never regenerated.
- Both comparator findings were FALSE — its `battle` field read the viewer's own prompt box.

## Review 1 — 2026-08-26 · the sea trial itself
**One sentence:** *"The unit shipped a process today and its very first output is a lie."*
- The gear picker read the working tree, so **committing a fix made it report "nothing to prove"** —
  following the rules exactly was a complete bypass.
- `rec.finished = recA || recB` → a host finishing while the guest sat stuck reported "finished".
- Crew-on-a-phone — the square he actually playtests — had no leg at all.
