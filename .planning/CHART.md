# THE CHART — the one plan

*Wyclau's single plan file (charter part 1). The launch line worked backwards from the date, the
idea inbox, and what's blocked on Wyatt. Sessions: enter through the Door
(`.claude/skills/door/SKILL.md`), claim before editing, keep this file current — it is the source
the Glass derives from.*

**Until the cutover, the per-bug game backlog stays in [`BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md)** — the
Razer engine works from it. This file owns the launch line and the reboot. *(The Mac fix session
that was also working it is archived as of 2026-08-31.)*

---

## THE LAUNCH LINE

Mission: the Reddit launch (overdue since ~2026-07-30; the date gets committed at the end of
step 2). Wyatt's five-item bar is step 3.

| # | Step | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The reboot** (Door, Glass, watchdog, rulebook, memory, pruning) | **IN PROGRESS** — see checklist below |
| 2 | **The foundation** (one-director rebuild, 6 steps) | **DONE, in every step that can be.** Steps 1-5 shipped (step 5 as the narrow half, his ruling, 2026-08-31); step 6 largely already enforced by existing gates. **Launch date proposed here.** |
| 3 | **The launch list**: finished feel solo+crew · tutorial · analytics · code-privacy decision · SEO | not started; sized at step 2 |
| 4 | **Launch, then the till** (accounts + paid merch, +1 month) | not started |

## STEP 1 CHECKLIST — the reboot (estimate 2–3 days from 2026-08-31; re-sized end of day one)

*Open items carrying `GATED:` are not currently actionable — say why right after the marker. This
is the literal string the keep-working Stop hook parses (`.claude/hooks/wyclau-stop-keep-working.cjs`)
to tell "nothing left to do" from "something left, but it waits on Wyatt/a dependency" — keep it
exact, or the hook is wrong in whichever direction this list is wrong.*

- [x] Charter approved (2026-08-31, amendment: daily lessons)
- [x] The Chart exists (this file)
- [x] The Door exists (`.claude/skills/door/SKILL.md`)
- [x] The Glass generator exists (`scripts/wyclau/glass.mjs`) and the first Glass is published
- [x] Watchdog scripts + Razer setup guide exist (`scripts/wyclau/`)
- [x] **The Razer hour** — watchdog registered, engine launched, stall test passed through the scheduled task (2026-08-31 16:19Z)
- [ ] 24-hour unattended engine run, zero silent stalls — GATED: passive, monitor only; nothing to DO but watch the clock since the Razer hour (16:19Z)
- [ ] Rulebook cutover: `CLAUDE-next.md` replaces `.claude/CLAUDE.md`; war stories → `.claude/rules/*.md` at their triggers — GATED: at the quiet moment, needs the parallel fix session closed
- [ ] Memory consolidation: five homes → one + pointers — GATED: same quiet moment
- [ ] Pruning: kill-list generated (GSD phase machinery, dead files), archived in git, deleted; goes on the Glass for the record — GATED: same quiet moment
- [x] Gate retirement policy wired (quiet per-bug gates → archive; suite ceiling) — SHIPPED 2026-08-31 19:52Z. `gates.ceiling` in `package.json` (started at the exact current total, 71, so the next gate is the first conscious decision) + `scripts/qa/gate_ceiling_check.mjs`, red-proofed by planting `total=72` on the real file and watching it fail before restoring it. `scripts/qa/quiet_gate_report.mjs` (advisory, NOT in `npm test` — retirement stays a human call, per `docs/HARD-WON-LESSONS.md` §12i) lists real wired-in per-bug gates only, after a scoping bug caught before shipping: it first matched every `w##_/q##_` FILE in `scripts/qa/`, including one-off probes never wired into the suite at all. `scripts/qa/gate_archive/` exists for retirements. Full policy: `docs/GATE-RETIREMENT.md`. npm test 71/71.
- [x] **Glass v2 — the two-way interface** (ideas box on the page; the page saves itself; sessions woken by his writes; harvest rule in the Door; gate `glass_roundtrip_check`, red-proofed both ways) — shipped 2026-08-31, first live save pending Wyatt's first tap
- [ ] wyclau source moves to claude-kit as the kit's first module; pastrypirates vendors it *(his pick 2026-08-31)*
- [x] Mechanically enforce the Glass harvest rule — `.claude/hooks/glass-harvest-first.cjs` + gate `glass_harvest_hook_check` (red first on the unregistered-hook case, red-proofed both ways), 2026-08-31
- [x] **THE KEEP-WORKING STOP HOOK — SHIPPED 2026-08-31.** Wyatt: *"why have you stopped working? your mission is to continuously work until every single task is finished... we already know that behavioral fixes get ignored."* `.claude/hooks/wyclau-stop-keep-working.cjs`, registered in `settings.json`'s `Stop` array, **fires in every session, interactive included** (his correction, overriding his own first answer to the question this needed — see below). Five brakes, in order: (0) `stop_hook_active` never blocks twice in one turn; (1) `.planning/wyclau/PREEMPT.md` — his steering wheel, read BEFORE the Chart, outranks current work; (2) the Glass publish lag (moved here from `npm test`, CEO Review 52); (3) gives up after 3 blocks on the same item with no commit landing in between, rather than looping forever; (4) allows the stop once every open `STEP 1 CHECKLIST` line is either done or carries the literal marker `GATED:` — that marker retrofitted onto the Chart's own four genuinely-gated lines in the same commit, replacing inconsistent prose parentheticals a hook cannot parse reliably. Gate `scripts/qa/wyclau_stop_hook_check.mjs`, 14 cases against the real hook file (never a copy — HARD-WON-LESSONS §12i), red-proofed by planting a broken GATED-filter and watching case 4 fail, and by fabricating an unregistered `settings.json`. **Asked with the question UI before shipping** (his own instruction — this one decision was his to make, not mine): whether it should fire only in unattended sessions. First answer "only unattended", corrected within the same exchange to "all sessions." npm test 72/72.
- [x] **GLASS REDESIGN — Wyatt's seven priorities, in his words** — SHIPPED 2026-08-31 18:37Z, rendered and screenshotted locally (light + dark) before publishing, one real mojibake bug found and fixed by looking at the picture. Full detail in `scripts/wyclau/glass.mjs`'s own header.
  - **[x] LAST PROGRESS VS PAGE PUBLISHED — SHIPPED 2026-08-31 20:04Z.** His measured finding: the dot read 🔴 54 min ago while a commit had landed 12 minutes earlier, because the old code drove the dot from `state.generatedAt` (page age) not real evidence. Two numbers now shown and computed separately: "last progress" (the newer of HEARTBEAT/LAST-ACTIVITY, read BEFORE this run's own write, so running glass.mjs is never mistaken for progress) and "page published" (`generatedAt`). **Traced and stated honestly, not oversold**: since the page is static once published, neither number can retroactively reflect work that happens AFTER the last generation — the exact reported false alarm is closed only by the third part, republishing being made mechanical. Red-proofed: ran genuinely red before the first publish+mark, genuinely green after.
    - **⚠ CORRECTION, CEO Review 52, SAME DAY, IN THE OPEN.** The line above originally said the publish-lag check lived in `scripts/qa/glass_publish_lag_check.mjs`, wired into `npm test`. CEO Review 52 found that real and correct — AND a genuine defect: it made the game's own release gate (`npm test`, required green before staging/merge per CLAUDE.md §6) dependent on whether the wyclau DASHBOARD had been republished recently. A stale Glass could have blocked a real game fix from reaching players. **Moved the same day**: the check now lives as a brake inside `.claude/hooks/wyclau-stop-keep-working.cjs` (fires on session Stop, never on `npm test`); the standalone gate script was deleted; `gates.total`/`ceiling` correctly dropped 72→71 with the removal, then rose 71→72 again for the Stop-hook's own gate (`scripts/qa/wyclau_stop_hook_check.mjs`, 14 cases, red-proofed both by planting a broken hook and by fabricating an unregistered `settings.json`). Also corrected the same review caught: `glass.mjs`'s own comment had overclaimed that an "administrative re-run… now correctly shows an older last progress" as settled behaviour — measured instead, `.claude/hooks/wyclau-pulse.cjs` stamps LAST-ACTIVITY on every tool call rate-limited to one minute, so during active work the two numbers are typically within about a minute of each other; the comment now says so.
  1. Save space -- remove "Pastry Pirates -- the engine's one honest window. Branch claude/cloud-handoff-planning-a9ay1u."
  2. "I want to see that the work is being done, right at the top, at a glance. A small emoji + a timestamp since last progress is perfect -- remove the entire 'Alive' box."
  3. Rename "Write to Claude" to **Ideas** and put it below Your Call.
  4. Reformat Shipped Today: **remove the commit codes -- they mean nothing to me** -- make them more visual and clearer to read, ideally 5-7 words each. His two examples of what is inscrutable: "`f3d3ee9b` ledger: the harvest hazard fired for real (safely) -- evidence, not prediction" and "`3934d9d4` ledger: retract the Glass v2 claim -- the Mac boardroom session claimed first, and holds it". Put below Your Call. *(Note for whoever builds it: a generator cannot summarise a bad subject line into a good one. The durable half is a commit convention -- sessions write a subject he can read -- with the generator stripping prefixes, hashes and everything after the dash. Say which half you did.)*
  5. Put **Your Call in its own box** (above Shipped Today), and **show him a few test calls** so he can check the format is intuitive.
  6. **Merge "On the Chart" with "The Reboot Checklist" -- one source of tasks**, reprioritised as needed, which the Blade Pirates process is always working. *(This item lives in the merged list once it exists.)*
  7. Reformat everything to look **more like a dashboard**, easily scannable, and **matching the colours of the game**.

- [x] **ONE PUBLISHER for the Glass** — SHIPPED 2026-08-31. `.planning/wyclau/GLASS-NOTE.md`, tracked: another session writes there and commits instead of publishing; the Bosun folds it into the page and resets the file on its next pulse. Gate `glass_note_relay_check.mjs`, red-proofed (the pre-fix code cannot even run the check — the mechanism did not exist to test). Screenshotted before shipping.
- [x] **Fold the Helm into the Glass** — decision cards live INSIDE the Glass, derived from this file's own tables; the Helm URL serves a retirement notice (2026-08-31, his instruction)

## BLOCKED ON WYATT

*(nothing — he has ruled on all six. See RULED, below.)*

## RULED — his answers, and what each one unblocks

**Harvested 2026-08-31 from the Helm's state block, over an hour after he made them.** Full
record with the failure it exposes: [`.claude/memory/DECISIONS.md`](../.claude/memory/DECISIONS.md).

| item | HIS RULING | now |
|---|---|---|
| Live audio defect (8s full-volume storm per ship) | **"Yes — delete the line"** | **CLOSED, NOT BUILT — the ruling was on a stale premise.** Measured 2026-08-31 18:12Z: `soundForEvent({t:"anchorHold"})` returns `{name:"fishing",bus:"master"}`, `EVENT_SOUND` declares `anchorHold` exactly once (`src/ui/audio.js:105`), and `node scripts/audio_mapping_test.js` PASSes all three of DEFECT-1/2's own regression guards. The fix shipped at the cutover, commit `fb74eedc`, before today — `docs/AUDIO.md`'s own correction box says so and names this exact trap. There is no line to delete. Same shape as the sea-trial-PR correction the same day: a question was put to him from a stale reading. |
| Pass-and-play hand-over ahead of the turn | **"Just move it"** — no A/B switch, make the change | **ALREADY SHIPPED before the ruling was harvested.** Commit `ae75fe63` ("the device changes hands before the screen changes captain"), 2026-08-31 12:51Z — over four hours before his 17:08Z ruling reached anyone. `humanTurn()`'s own comment quotes him: *"Move it, I trust the plan."* All three pass-and-play hand-over sites (turn, secret draft, bake) gate before the screen switches captain; `node scripts/qa/handover_before_turn_check.mjs` PASSes, including its red-proof of the backwards order. Nothing to build. |
| One-director step 5 (Decider scope) | **"Narrow half"** — three drawing branches behind the Decider; the two questions stay two | **ALREADY SHIPPED before the ruling was harvested.** Commit `44dc853e` ("step 5, the narrow half: the secrecy rules move to one pure place"), 2026-08-31 12:54Z — over four hours before the 17:09Z ruling. `mayRevealRecipe`/`offersRecipeCheck`/`showsThinkingIndicator` in `src/shared/visibility.js` are the one pure rule; `board.js`/`stage.js` supply facts (`sharedDevice: appState.passAndPlay`) rather than branching. `decisionIsLocal` still the sole other predicate, unmerged, per the ruling. Both `scripts/qa/decider_table_check.mjs` and `scripts/qa/visibility_rules_shared_check.mjs` PASS, red-proofed. Nothing to build. |
| The plan document vs the measured tree | **"Yes — make the measured table the plan of record"** | **DONE 2026-08-31 18:35Z.** The only one of the four genuinely unbuilt when picked up. Republished [One Engine, One Director](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/715b29fe-fe33-4038-9e61-a20ef6676570) §07: each of the six migration steps now carries its real status inline (four SHIPPED, one dead-premise-closed, one largely-enforced) instead of reading as a plain to-build list; the footer's "nothing has been built" claim corrected to match. Nothing else on the page touched. |
| The cutover moment | **"After the exit test verdict"** — the 24-hour no-silent-stall run finishes first | SCHEDULED, gated on the exit test |
| The Razer hour | done 2026-08-31, 16:19Z | closed |

## THE FOUNDATION, AS MEASURED 2026-08-31 — not as the plan describes it

*The plan (`architecture-one-director.html`) was written from a reading that predates several
convergences. Every row below was checked against the tree, not against the document.*

| step | the plan says | the tree says |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · storyboard, route one kind through it | to build | **DONE.** `present()` in `src/shared/storyboard.js`, `playStoryboard()` in `src/ui/flow.js`, `sail` converted. No player-visible change — see step 2. |
| 2 · put the route on the event, guest walks real water — *"first visible win"* | to build | **ALREADY SHIPPED.** The route rides on the event as `draw.route` and `consumeEvent` walks it on every client. There is no visible win left to claim. |
| 3 · one fact for whose turn it is | struck by measurement | **DONE**, by commit `5e9ee2b1`, before the run that checked it. `setActor` has one caller. |
| 4 · storyboard parity gate | to build, after two kinds | **DONE**, built after one kind on purpose — the plan's own reason is to guard the migration rather than certify it. Golden file, one process, no browser. |
| 5 · the Decider interface | to build | **DONE, the narrow half — shipped 12:54Z, ruled 17:09Z.** Two orthogonal predicates stay two, per his ruling. The three mode reads that decided what is *drawn* moved to one pure rule module, `src/shared/visibility.js`; the drawing code only supplies facts. |
| 6 · delete old paths, layering gate strict | to build | **LARGELY ALREADY ENFORCED.** All three layering rules the plan asks for already fail the build; proven by planting each violation. |

## THE IDEA INBOX

*Drop ideas here in any words, any time, through any session ("add to the chart: …"). Each gets a
fate — SHIPPED / SCHEDULED (where) / PARKED (why) — with a recommendation, within a day.*

- **CEO Review 51's small finding**: `quiet_gate_report.mjs`'s naming convention (`^[wq]\d+_`)
  misses `a1_bake_now_check.mjs` / `a2_bot_bake_watch_check.mjs` — two real per-item gates that are
  neither structural nor currently reportable as retirement candidates. → **PARKED, low priority**:
  widen the regex to also match `a\d+_` whenever someone is next in `quiet_gate_report.mjs` for
  another reason; not worth a standalone session, since the report already covers every gate that
  matches its stated convention and found zero candidates either way today.

- **"Test to send to the chart"** (written on the Glass, 18:27:43Z) → **SHIPPED, and this IS the
  fate.** Read literally: the two-way save it exercises is exactly what it tested — the idea
  reached `glassState.ideas` on the live artifact and this harvest is that path completing end to
  end for the first time since Glass v2 shipped. No further action; the mechanism it was testing
  now has its first real proof.

## FATES DECIDED

- **"The Glass becomes our two-way interface"** (Wyatt, 2026-08-31) → **SCHEDULED**: Glass v2
  today after the Razer hour; wyclau source homes in claude-kit now. GitHub Pages was considered
  and set aside for the private interface (public by nature, no write path without glue) —
  **reconsider at launch** as a public, player-facing status page for the game.
