# BACKLOG — everything deliberately NOT done before the cutover

**Created 2026-08-26** when Wyatt called the cutover: *"Only game stopping blocker bugs must be
solved before the cutover; everything else should be added to a durable backlog file for future
processes."*

**There was no standalone backlog file before this one** — only a `## Backlog` section inside
`ROADMAP.md`, which is milestone-scoped and gets archived with its milestone. **This file is not.**
It outlives milestones on purpose.

**How to use it:** add anything you decide not to do, with WHY it was deferred. Nothing here is
forgotten-by-accident; everything here is deferred-on-purpose, which is a different thing and the
whole reason the file exists.

## 🔴 TOP OF THE LIST — sail squares a guest cannot tap

**Deferred at the cutover by Wyatt's explicit call, 2026-08-26, on the understanding that it is
written down rather than forgotten. It is the first thing to pick up.**

`crew-phone`, guest, during a **tap-to-sail** prompt — `crew-phone-guest-006-settled.png`:

```
FAIL on-screen      : clickable off-screen: sailCell, sailCell
FAIL not-occluded   : sailCell covered by #pp4Cap
FAIL sail-clickable : 3 sail square(s) covered
```

Two sail squares are off the screen and one sits under the captains panel, so **a guest on a phone
has legal moves they cannot reach.** D-38's ruling is that a control you cannot hit is *the one
unacceptable outcome*, and crew-on-a-phone is the square Wyatt actually playtests.

- **It is on the SETTLED shot, not mid-animation.** The gate separates those (`fails` vs
  `motionOnly`, `playtest_gate.mjs`) and this is in `fails`.
- **It is the ONLY structural failure across 281 screens** in the final trial. Everything else is clean.
- **Why it was deferred:** unlike the cutover's other blockers it is unbounded — the board's visible
  band fighting the captains panel at phone height, not a find-and-replace.
- **Where to start:** `boardBand()` and `capBandBottom()` in the promoted `src/ui/stage.js`, and
  `docs/BOARD-RENDERING.md`.

## 🔴 SEO — currently broken, and the cutover is when it starts to matter

Nobody can find this game today. Until now that was correct (`/4` was a dev preview); the moment it
is the front door, it is a real problem.

- [ ] **`noindex, nofollow` in the promoted `index.html`** — *(if the cutover shipped, this was fixed
      as a blocker; verify it. If it is still there, Google is being told to forget the site.)*
- [ ] **`robots.txt`** still carries `Disallow: /4/`, plus `/v2/`, `/v2bakeoff/`, `/3/`, `/lab.html`,
      `/stats.html`. Re-point it at the promoted layout and at `/classic`.
- [ ] **`sitemap.xml`** lists `/` and `/about.html` only, and describes the OLD game. It needs the
      promoted URLs and `/classic`.
- [ ] **The page `<title>`** — was *"Pastry Pirates — v3 bot test"*. Fix if the cutover did not.
- [ ] **No meta description**, no Open Graph / Twitter card. A link shared to a friend or posted
      anywhere renders as a bare URL with no picture and no sentence. **This is the highest-value SEO
      item for a game that spreads by people sending it to each other.**
- [ ] **No structured data** (schema.org `VideoGame`). Cheap, and it is what makes a rich result.
- [ ] **Nothing has ever been measured** — no Search Console, no idea what the site ranks for or
      whether it is indexed at all.

## 🔴 A tutorial for first-time players

A new player currently gets the *"Ahoy! Choose a recipe, gather each ingredient, then sail home
first to win!"* line and then a board with no explanation of how anything works.

- [ ] **Decide the shape first — this is Wyatt's call, not a mechanism question.** Options: a guided
      first voyage; a short interstitial before the first game; contextual first-time-only hints on
      each new control; or a "How to play" that is actually read.
- [ ] `How to play` exists in the menu — **find out whether anyone opens it** before building a
      second thing beside it.
- [ ] The game already teaches one gesture well and it is a good model to copy: *"Tap and hold the
      sea to reveal the board"* appears in-context, at the moment it is needed, and retires itself
      once learned (`PEEK_LEARNED`, `4/src/ui/stage.js`).
- [ ] **Watch a real first-timer play before designing this.** Nobody in this repo has.

## 🟠 Known bugs, deferred as not game-stopping

- [ ] **"Play again!" covers the award cards** at end of voyage — flagged **6 times** across two sea
      trials, every phone leg and Safari. **It is the DOCUMENTED design** (sticky was chosen because
      a button below the fold was worse). A third option exists and is unbuilt: pin it as a FOOTER
      outside the scroller — always visible AND never covering. **Cost: `#statsWrap` is also the
      draggable park sheet (D-14), so the gesture needs hand-verification.** Wyatt's call.
- [ ] **`deny` is never exercised** in crew games. A theory that it shared a cause with the covering
      bug was written down in advance and **disproved**. Unexplained.
- [ ] **31% of screens never settle** before being checked — all now reporting `churn: geometry`
      (the text class is fixed). Something moves >8px for 2.6s+. Diagnosable but undiagnosed.
- [ ] **8 of Wyatt's 35 playtest items untouched**; 5 parked with written diagnoses.
      See `.planning/phases/02.3-the-two-hour-playtest/TRIAGE.md`.
- [ ] **Large empty gap in the desktop right-hand column** at 1890x960 — pre-existing, taste, his call.

## 🟠 Process debt

- [ ] **The seeded-defect drill still cannot fail.** `4/scripts/qa/seed_drill.mjs:72` grades on the
      leg's **exit status**, and the leg fails on its own for unrelated reasons — so every seed scores
      CAUGHT whether the bug is present or not. **Fix: run one UNSEEDED baseline first and grade each
      seed only on failures the baseline did not have.** ~15 lines.
      **Until this exists there is no evidence the sea trial catches Wyatt's bugs.**
- [ ] **Nothing gates the push.** A ~15-line `pre-push` hook could refuse game code without a
      completed sea trial for that build stamp — and would also dodge the post-push gear blindness.
- [ ] **Red-proof meta-gate** — nothing verifies the 34 gates can go red. Only 5 of 42 scripts carry
      a `FAILURE DEMONSTRATION` header; it is a habit, not a gate.
- [ ] **Trigger-fired lessons** — extend `.claude/hooks/` so a lesson arrives when you are about to
      make the mistake, not at session start. The rule-17 hook proves the pattern works.
- [ ] **Volume**: `HARD-WON-LESSONS.md` is ~1316 lines and CLAUDE.md ~960, and every session is told
      to read both. CEO review 5 recommends collapsing §10c/e/f/g to one line each.

## 🟡 Roadmap phases deferred past the cutover

- [ ] **Phase 5 — Trade Over the Wire.** Multi-captain trade inside one turn, counter-offers across
      the wire, a guest with the same controls as the host.
- [ ] **Phase 7 — The Board Fits.** The whole board visible on a laptop.
- [ ] **Phase 8 — A Desktop Worth the Width.**
- [ ] **Phase 9 — The Written Record.** The rules rewritten from the code; ~40 rulings and 13
      approved copy strings lifted out of commit bodies.
- [ ] **Tidy-up**: `v2/`, `v2bakeoff/` and `3/` still exist in the working tree.
- [ ] **Safari storm on a real device** — never measured on this build. Headless WebKit now runs in
      the sea trial, but `DRIVING-THE-GAME.md` §9 is explicit: *"Chrome is not Safari… a green
      harness still earns a human Safari pass."*
